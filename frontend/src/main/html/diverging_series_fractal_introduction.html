These Fractals are described with the use of two mathematical formulas.
The first formula defines how to start the iteration. It is named <code>initial</code>.
The second formula defined how to continue the iteration. It is named <code>initial</code>.
For example is the famous Mandelbrot fractal created with <code>initial(lambda) = 0</code> and <code>iteration(z, lambda) = z^2 + lambda</code>.
