<h1>Nutria - Fractal Explorer</h1>

<h2>What is a fractal?</h2>
<p>
     Giving an accurate definition of a fractal is not really easy, but for the purpose of this projects it enough to say that a fractal is an image with infinite depth.
     That means you can zoom into it and will always continue to unfold its structure.

<h2>What is Nutria?</h2>
<p>Nutria is basically a gallery of fractals and it contains a convenient tool to explore such fractals.</p>
<p>Fractals usually have a lot of parameters. Nutria allows you to try out new configurations for these parameters which might yield completely new images.</p>
