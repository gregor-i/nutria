Newton Fractals are described with the use of two mathematical formulas.
The first formula defines how to start the iteration. It is named <code>initial</code>.
The second formula defined how to continue the iteration. It is named <code>initial</code>.
Newton Fractals are based on Newton's Method.
It is an root finding algorithm and Newton Fractals get interesting when Newton's Method fails.
More roots to find make the fractal more interesting.
