        Introduction to Nutria
    </h1>
    <p>
        Nutria contains of 3 Components: The <strong>Explorer</strong>, the <strong>Gallery</strong> and the <strong>Template Editor</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Explorer</strong> is an iterative Tool to explore a fractal and to try out new configurations.
        Most fractals are configurable.
        For example are most fractals bound by a maximal number of iterations. Changing this value is easy and the result is quickly visible.
        Additionally functions can be used as parameters. For example the famous Mandelbrot iterations is <code>z*z + lambda</code>, changing this function to
        <code>z*z + 0.285 + 0.01 * i</code> yields an julia fractal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Explored fractals can be downloaded or saved.
        Saved fractals will be listed in <strong>My Gallery</strong>.
        Exploration can be conveniently continued from there.
        Fractals can also be published from there.
        Published Fractals will be listed in the <strong>Public Gallery</strong> and all users might see them and continue to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third component is the <strong>Template Editor</strong>.
        It is intended to be used by experienced users as it required some insight into Nutria and into programming.
        All fractals in Nutria are based on templates.
        Templates define the executed code and all possible parameters.
