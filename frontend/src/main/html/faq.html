    <h2>Why is this project called Nutria?</h2>
    <p>
        In theoretical computer science there is the concept of fix point operators to formalize recursion.
        The fix point operator for unfolding recursion is called <code>Nu</code> (after the greek letter Î½).
        As most fractals utilize an unfolding recursion, I think this is a fitting name for this project.

<div class="section content" id="zooming">
    <h2>After zooming, the image becomes pixelated. Why is that?</h2>
    <p>
        Zooming in makes the distances between the coordinates of pixels become smaller and smaller.
        At at certain point the distance is so small, that there are no more number between these pixels (at least for the computer).
        At that point the image becomes pixelated.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the technical details:
        Nutria uses WebGL 1.0 Fragment Shader and they only support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">single precision floating point numbers</a>.

    <h2>What functions are allowed to describe formulas?</h2>
    <p>
        Nutria supports these complex number operations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Addition: <code>a + b</code></li>
        <li>Subtraction: <code>a - b</code></li>
        <li>Multiplication: <code>a * b</code></li>
        <li>Division: <code>a / b</code></li>
        <li>Power: <code>a ^ b</code></li>
        <li>Exp and Log: <code>exp(x)</code> and <code>log(x)</code></li>
        <li>Sin, Cos, Tan: <code>sin(x)</code>, <code>cos(x)</code> and <code>tan(x)</code></li>
        <li>And their inverses: <code>asin(x)</code>, <code>acos(x)</code> and <code>atan(x)</code></li>
        <li>And their hyperbolics: <code>sinh(x)</code>, <code>cosh(x)</code> and <code>tanh(x)</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Naturally Nutria supports precedence.
        So power operators have precedence over the multiplication and division operators and
        multiplication and division operators have precedence over the addition and subtraction operators.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complex numbers can be constructed with use of real numbers and <code>i</code> (the imaginary unit).
        For Example: <code>12.1 + 5*i</code> and <code>3.41 * i + 2</code>
