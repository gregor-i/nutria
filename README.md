Fractals - they go on forever.

##Project structure
- `core` is the library implementing the complete rendering pipeline for implementing various fractals.
- `data` contains a few preconfigured viewports and pipelines that were found to be interresting in some way.
- `processor` is a command line batch runner for generating a bunch of renderings unattended.
- `viewer` is an interactive GUI application for _exploring_ fractals and how they come to be.

##Install instructions
Just fire up `sbt` and `compile` or `run` the subproject you are interrested in.
